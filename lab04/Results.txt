Notes (what the above indicates):

* Random order input demands relatively similar cost regardless of
tree datatype with the exception of splay trees

* (L) Insertion at Leaf: At the bottom of the tree
Insertion at leaf in ascending order requires the greatest number of
comparisons. A comparison must be made while traversing the entire branch,
but entire branch is linear (hence the 5000 depth), and each new node
must be placed at the bottom. However, random order and prefix order
have a notably smaller depth and hence cost. This is because the trees are
more likely to be balanced, are already balanced, respectively.

* (A) At root
In ascending order produces maximal depth and hence greatest cost. Prefix
produces multiple occurrences of single branching, which slightly reduces the
comparisons needed.

* (R) L and A randomly
Combined use balance out the tree; relatively lower costs overall.

* (V) AVL self-balancing:
AVL significantly less costly with R input as it guarantees to maintain
balance and maximises the "binary" component of BSTs. Log(n). Because the
AVL approach requires constant balancing, the depth of the tree is kept to
a minimum.

* (S) Splay:
Splay has low cost because nodes are moved toward the root. When
values are in a random order, the depth increases exponentially.
This is due to numbers being more "slanted" towards a particular number
e.g. more numbers are greater than 300 and hence leaning towards the right.
This is unlike ascending/prefix order which can be split relatively evenly
between left and right branches.
